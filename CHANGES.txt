blargg-adb-teensy-2
-------------------
* Changed polling to 12ms (83Hz). Works better with M0116. Can still be adjusted back to 8ms (125Hz) in main.c
* Fixed dropped key when it's pressed and released in same ADB event.
* Reorganized code to be in sync with v-usb version.
* Disable interrupts for all ADB transactions.
* Send each ADB event byte as a separate USB report. This ensures things are in order and cleanly handles cases when the same key is pressed then released in a single ADB event.
