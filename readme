ADB-to-USB Converter using Teensy
---------------------------------
This is a simple Mac ADB keyboard to ADB converter using a Teensy++ 2.0 AVR development board. The ADB code is based on the t.m.k. Keyboard Firmware Collection, with some timing improvements to make it more robust. It uses PJRC's usb_keyboard driver for USB. I wrote this while debugging some problems with the ADB code and because the TMK collection was too big for me to understand clearly.

This is mainly meant as simple demo of the ADB code and a way to test it in a small program.

Currently this doesn't support the locking caps lock key of Apple keyboards, instead assuming you've modified to be a momentary key like the others.

Code uses small shell that provides debugging output on USART port at 57600 bits per second (port D3 on a Teensy++ 2.0). Can be disabled in makefile with NDEBUG. It prints each word received from the keyboard. adb.c does NOT use anything from the shell, so it's standalone.
